Name:           Francisco McGee
Assignment:     Bias, Variance
Github:         https://github.com/alagauche/Francisco_BiasVariance 

INSTRUCTIONS:
The only important file is the ipython notebook:

    Francisco_BiasVariance.py

Please open and run that file.

CHALLENGES/LIMITATIONS:
Not enough time to complete assignment with full understanding of
content.

I want to understand how to quickly visually detect bias and variance
in the KNN plots.
